# LNK Sessions

# Nov 2015 - Python Koans

Session on learning python by solving test cases
Instructions:
1 - Download and install python v2.7 at https://www.python.org/downloads/ (setup instructions https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html )
2 - Download the lnk zip - https://github.com/mickrideout/lnk/archive/master.zip
3 - In the directory lnk/src/python_koans/python2 run the command "python comtemplate_koans.py" .. It will show an error like:
  Please meditate on the following code:
  File "/home/mick/src/lnk/src/python_koans/python2/koans/about_asserts.py", line 18, in test_assert_truth
    self.assertTrue(False)  # This should be true

4 - From this you can see that there is a problem in the about_asserts.py file at line 18.. Solve the problem and rerun the command. Solve every problem in every file it states to learn python.
